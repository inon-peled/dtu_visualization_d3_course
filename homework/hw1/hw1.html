<h2>Part 1: DAOST Chapter 2 Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Q: Explain in your own words the point of the jitter plot.</p>
            <p>A: The point of the jitter box is to visually distinguish between overlapping points in one dimensional
                data, while keeping points close to their original locations.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>
                Q: Explain in your own words the point of figure 2-3.
                (I'm going to skip saying \"in your own words\" going forward, but I hope you get the point;
                I expect all answers to be in your own words)
            </p>
            <p>
                A: The point of figure 2-3 is to show a disadvantage of histograms, namely their sensitivity to placement
                of bin edges, such that the same data appears very differently distributed for different choices of
                anchor points. This also means that there is generally no one-to-one correspondence between histogram
                and data.

                Q: The author of DAOST (Philipp Janert) likes KDEs (and think they're better than histograms).
                And I don't. I didn't give a detailed explanation in the video, but now that works to my advantage.
                I'll ask you guys to think about this and thereby create an excellent exercise:
                When can KDEs be misleading? </p>
            <p>
                A: KDE can be misleading when e.g. visualizing few samples from a uniform distribution. If the samples
                are spaced widely, the resulting KDE will look like a sequence of hills, whereas the actual distribution
                is a horizontal interval. Conversely, a histogram with few bins will faithfully represent the
                distribution.

        <li><p>
                Q: I've discussed some strengths of the CDF - there are also weaknesses.
                Janert writes "[CDFs] have less intuitive appeal than histograms or KDEs". What does he mean by that?
            </p>
            <p>
                A: Because a CDF is cumulative, it does not immediately convey the shape of the density function, but
                rather allow to quickly answer questions about totals. In contrast, histograms and KDE suggest the
                form of the underlying density function.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Q: What is a Quantile plot? What is it good for?</p>
            <p>A: A quantile plot is a graph of the CDF with the x and y axes interchanged. Thus a quantile plot
            conveys the same information as CDF, but allows more easily to derive any quantile, i.e. the smallest datum
                which is greater than X% of the data.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Q: How is a Probablity Plot defined? What is it useful for? Have you ever seen one before?</p>
            <p>A: A probability plot is a method for showing how close a data set is to another
                distribution, while also showing estimates for some summary statistics, such as mean and
                standard deviation. The other distribution may be theoretical or empirical, namely a second data set.
                I have seen probability plots before, yay.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><p> Q: One of the reasons I like DAOST is that Janert is so suspicious of mean, median,
            and related summary statistics. Explain why one has to be careful when using those -
            and why visualization of the full data is always better.</p>
            <p>A: Data sets with very different underlying distributions may have the same summary statistics, hence
                summary statistics are not sufficient information about distributions. An acute example of this is
                Anscombe's Quartet. Therefore, to convey the main properties of a distribution, visualization of the
                full data must accompany the summary statistics.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Q: I love box plots. When are box plots most useful?</p>
            <p>A: Box plots compactly present summary statistics, main quantiles, and outliers. The boxes and outliers
            are drawn in proprtion to the width of the distribution at hand, hence box plots are useful for comparing
            the main structural properties of several data sets: widths, location, and frequency of outliers.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Q: The book doesn't mention <href a="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_plot">violin plots</href>.
            Are those better or worse than box plots? Why?</p>
            <p>A: Compared to box plots, violin plots add more information, such as shape of data density. Neither
                method is better or worse, rather each may be more appropriate depending on what properties we wish
            to visually convey. If we wish to convey quantile structure and outliers, box plots are more suitable,
                whereas if we wish to convey overall density shape, violin plots are more suitable. </p>
