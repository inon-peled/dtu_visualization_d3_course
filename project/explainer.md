## Motivation

We are working with two datasets in this project:

1. New York taxi data: A dataset containing a lot of information, e.g dropoffs, price, time etc of trips with the yellow New York Taxis. 
2. New York event data: A dataset that has been scraped from eventful, containing information about events happening all over new york. For the events we focused on a small group of selected venues. 

The motivation for this project is to create a research tool for the *machine learning for mobility*-group at DTU. Right now the group use a lot of manual labor to explore event data in NYC. They construct a large amount of plots to see which events could be interesting to look at in regards to impact on the flow of traffic in the vicinity of the event. We wish to make a interactive tool, that let's the user explore interesting points in time, simply by moving a slider that controls how extreme deviations from the normal he wants to see and then he can just simply click on these points to get a zoomed in view of both the flow of traffic at that time frame, as well as data about the events at that time. 

This tool will be a great help to the group, as it will be much easier to find relevant points in the big dataset, enabling acceleration of future research.

##Contributions

90% of the project was made at Inons office, where we used pair programming, sitting together on one screen to process and understand the data as well as create the visualizations in d3. Therefore in all practical regards, we have contributed equally to the project.
